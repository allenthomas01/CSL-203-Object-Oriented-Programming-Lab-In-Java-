### AIM :

To write a java program to find the frequency of a characters in a given string

### ALGORITHM :

1.	Start
2.	Declare string variables str and str1
3.	Declare integer variables i, len, count and initialize count as 0
4.	Declare character variables ch and ch1
5.	Read the string from the user and store it to str
6.	Convert the string in str to lowercase and store in str1
7.	Count the length of the string and store the value in len
8.	Read the character to find the frequency from the user and store it to ch
9.	Convert the character in ch to lowercase and store it in ch1 10.For the value of i = 0 to i<len do
a. If(ch1 == str1.charAt(i))
i.	Increase the value of count by 1. 11.Print the frequency of the character.
12.	Stop
